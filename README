This project intendes to explore and help define best practices for developing
JRuby on Rails webapps that leverage that extensive Java ecosystem. For
example, brownfield developments may introduce Rails, but have a large legacy
aspect that has no need to be discarded. This legacy code may be exposed via
standard mechanisms such as Spring, Servlets, Hibernate, etc. Maven is a
widely used project build system for Java and so integration with that
ecosystem is also higly desirable.
